Legends tell of a hellmouth--
a bottomless tomb where fools
in search of riches and fame
surrender their lives in
vanity and greed.
@
They speak of riches idle
in the depths, surrounded by
beings foul beyond
conception.
@
Those who endure even the
uppermost levels and escape
would find themselves never
wanting for earthly goods.
@
But far below at the
foundation of the earth
lies a mighty being,
the Pantokrator.
@
It is said that this being is
able to grant any 3 wishes
to those who find it.
@
What do you seek, adventurer?
@
Do you think you will find it?
